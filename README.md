## Description

This project was a collaborative effort between four students from the University of Washington's Continuing and Professional Education Fullstack Bootcamp program. Contributors were Rainier Dotulong, Zhao Ming Zhong, Matthew Hoefer, and Gabriel Sowa.

- This project was motivated by a love for coding and dogs. The idea came together as the group considered ways to incorporate and evolve newfound knowledge in integration of third-party APIs with developing skills in HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript, and JQuery. The group settled on integrating several third-party APIs with considerable data on dog breeds to develop a page that can allow a user to search for a breed that may suit them based on a set of specified parameters.
- The developers of this project built it with a dual-minded intent: first, to provide a useful website to those who may be searching for or simply love reading about and looking at dogs and, second, to improve their web development skills and learn from their mistakes or challenges they encountered while building the code.
- This is a useful webpage in that it provides front-end users with the ability to discover and track real-world information regarding dog breeds. A user may engage with the website in order to learn more about specific breeds of dogs, discover breeds they know little to nothing about prior to use, or simply to browse various photos and information of dog breeds in an encyclopedic fashion.
- The developers of this project learned an immense amount from the creation of this project. Challenges abounded at every corner, from choosing proper (and technically suitable) APIs to matching JavaScript functionality to a fast-evolving client-presenting page. Furthermore, this was the developers' first time working on a complex, fullstack (front and backend) website with multiple-developer collaboration happening through live hosting on Github. Learning to use tools like Excalidraw, Kanban boards, and multiple branches via terminals was as much an aspect of the challenge as was the coding itself.

## UserStory

GIVEN I am a looking for a dog
WHEN I visit the homepage
THEN I am greeted with a website that can help me choose a breed
WHEN I click "Let's Get Started"
THEN I am presented with a user input page with numerous parameters
WHEN I choose a breed type on the input page
THEN I am taken to a results page with a photo and Wiki of my chosen breed
WHEN I choose the right side of the page (Build your dog) and select several parameters
THEN I am taken to a confirmation page with numerous results of dogs that match my preferences
WHEN I reach the confirmation page
THEN I can choose from "dog cards" with photos and names that match my preferences
WHEN I click "Choose me!" on one of the cards
THEN I am taken to the results page with a photo of that breed type and a Wiki about it

## Installation

- There is no specialized installation of third-party programs or data required to use this webpage. All functionality is built into the page itself via JavaScript and third-party APIs. Data is saved via JavaScript in a user's browser's local storage. The user can write to the page, come back, see their data, and keep track of favored dog breeds without any special profile or input.

## APIs

- Several server-side APIs were used in the creation of this webpage. Those include:

- The Dog API

## Usage

- Using this website is fairly straightforward. Once the page has loaded, the user will be greeted with a title and a date. That date will be the current day. The user will immediately see a list of hours ranging from 9am-5pm (the standard 8-hour workday) who's rows will be colored grey, blue, or green. If the row is grey, that indicates to the user that the hour of the row has already passed for the day. The same goes for blue if that hour is in the future (within the same day). If the row is green, that means that whatever the hour indicated by the row is happening live, right now, for the user. This time functionality is meant to give the user a simple, visualized way to see what tasks remain in their day and what tasks have already passed. The user may also enter data to the rows. There are two input columns: to do and notes. In the to do column, the user is invited to label the task that they have to do according to the hour. In the corresponding notes column, the user may enter anything that comes to mind about that task; common usecases may be particular challenges the task presents, people to work with or ask about the task, or parts of the task that are already complete.

## Bugs

- While there are no known "bugs" afflicting the page, functionality is far from perfect. Users should know:

## Credits

- The creation of this website would not have been possible without the hard work of the developers and the educators that support them.
